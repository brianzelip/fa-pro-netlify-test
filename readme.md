# fa-pro-netlify-test

Sandbox for deploying [pro font awesome icons via npm](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/using-package-managers) in production.

This is a research pivot learning sandbox venture, from static/roadblocks/headaches with another project deploying pro features via netlify.
